### Major Problems:

### Game's Instructions:

The game starts with a an instructions page where the player has to read. When the player is done reading the instructions, the player clicks the mouse and starts the game. When the player loses the game by finishing his lives, the player gets an game over page. To restart the game again the player can click the mouse again, and the player gets the istuctions page again and the game starts over the same way it happened the first time. 

The game is played by using the r keybutton and l keybutton (r and l stand for right and left) to move the paddle left and right across the game's canvas. By using these two keybuttons the player has to avoid the bouncing ball where it moves at different speed levels randomly, by moving the paddle left and right. With this taking place, if the player's paddle overlaps or touches the ball, the player loses lives.
