### Description of Game:

- It is a one player ping pong game. It includes a paddle and a bouncing ball. The ball should bounce off when it hits the paddle. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the player loses.

- I worked on coming up with the idea from a game to create. I watched these videos for inspiration and to get overview on the step. First video: https://youtu.be/vGLXx_OEtc4 and Tanay Singhal youtube videos on (Processing Pong Game).

- I worked on creating a bouncing ball that moves randomly around the screen and reflect when it hits any of the screen's edges. To recall on how to create the ball as an object oriented I went back to Professor Dan Shiffman's videos on Youtube on (What is Object-Oriented Programming?)
