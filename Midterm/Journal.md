### Description of Game:

- It is a one player ping pong game. It includes a paddle and a bouncing ball. The ball should bounce off when it hits the paddle. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the player loses.

- I worked on coming up with the idea from a game to create. I watched these videos for inspiration and to get overview on the step. First video: https://youtu.be/vGLXx_OEtc4 and Tanay Singhal youtube videos on (Processing Pong Game).

### 16 October 2020: 

- I worked on creating a bouncing ball that moves randomly around the screen and reflect when it hits any of the screen's edges. To recall on how to create the ball as an object oriented I went back to Professor Dan Shiffman's videos on Youtube on (What is Object-Oriented Programming?)

- I worked on adding the paddle to the code, however, the paddle didn't move neither right or left, it stayed still. I used the mousePress() at first it didn't work, so I went ahead and tried it with the keyPressed, it still didn't move.

- I tried working on differnt parts of the code and I figured that it has to be something within this part of the code but I wasn't sure what was it since when I changed it the paddle started to move in a weird way, I'm not sure how and why, but it did move down to the corner whithout the use of the keypressing function

- This is how it moved when I changed this part of the code

- After yesterday's work and not figuring out what was wrong, I decided to look at more videos for help. I used this video (https://youtu.be/vGLXx_OEtc4) to fix my problem which was in this part of the code. I didn't know what exaclty was the problem, maybe because the added the keyPressed() function outside the draw.

- This is how it turned after I adjusted the paddle's code.
