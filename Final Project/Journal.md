### Description of Project:

For the final project, I want to have a one side communication happening from processing to Arduino. In the processing screen I would have 4 circles and if any of the circles was pressed the screen changes, a song plays, and the LEDs blink as if they are dancing. Instead of having a dancing fountain I have dancing LEDs. 

### 26 November 2020:

- I started looking for inspirations for my final project and Dubai Mallâ€™s fountain was one. I wanted to have something similar where things dance as an output. So, I decided to have music playing and the LEDs blink as if they are dancing according the rhythm of the music.

- A video of the Dubai Mall's fountain:

- This is how is a simple sketch of how I imagine things will be:
