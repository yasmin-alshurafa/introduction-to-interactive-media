# Final Project: Responsive LEDs

## Final Project Journey

## Major Problems:

- The first problem was having the sound in the draw function without the it playing over and over again. It was resolved by googling my problem and following the tip provided by this [website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40712592/how-to-use-play-inside-draw-in-processing-3) and it worked.

- The second problem is using the sound library to analyze the sound and get it to do something. I used the example found in processing (Processing > Examples > Contributed Examples > Learning Processing 2nd Edition > Chp 20 Sound > Example 8 Playback Analysis) which helped being a basis for my work.

- The third problem was getting different sounds to play at different button presses. I used this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17556228/how-to-play-only-one-audio-file-at-a-time-in-minim) as a guidance to solve this issue.

- The fourth problem was getting communication to happen from Arduino to Processing. To solve this issue I looked into Omar's [code](https://github.com/soablackwhite/Intro-to-IM/blob/master/Nov24th/multiplayer.pde) used in his November 24th assignment and followed the same methods. I also got some help from the professor by asking on Discord.

- The fifth problem was stopping the sound from playing. I tried different functions where are rewind(), pause(), close() and stop() functions until one of them worked well.

- The sixth problem was understanding how the boolean expressions worked. To solve this issue I anayzled how I used it in different parts of my code and used it once with *music==true* and once *music* alone. In this way I understood the logic of how it is used, where and why.
